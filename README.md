# Elevator Interface Project
This project was created by Colby Killian for CS 3366: Human Computer Interaction at Texas Tech University. 
The purpose of this project to learn about how systems that we interact on a day-to-day basis are designed. This project focused on the design of an elevator interface.

# The Elevator
The elevator I chose for this project is the TTU Media and Communications Office Tower elevator. I chose this specific elevator because I had never used it prior to this project, and I believe my first time experience would be beneficial to my project.

**Some issues with this design:**

 - Screen that shows which floor you are on/going to is very high up
 - Button layout is a bit janky because of the odd number of buttons
 - Buttons panel is very low, meaning tall people would have to bend over to see all of the buttons

**Good implementations with this design:**

- Buttons are very large and easy to press
- Buttons light up when pressed
- Numbers are easy to read
- Circular buttons are more aesthetically pleasing to look at and easier to press than square ones

In general, this design is very well implemented and is easy to use. Despite this, the interface can be improved to accommodate many users
